## Turngitin: a git backed app for code-based homework turn-in

I use [gitosis](http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way) for the turn-in of exams/homeworks, but seeing that a [web admin](https://github.com/masone/gitosis-web-admin) exists, I thought it would be neat for students to just paste their public ssh keys somewhere and teachers to just fill a form and have the private repos and notifications and all in one place. And this strives to be the place.

For more details on what it does and what it doesn't, read the features and/or the tests :)
